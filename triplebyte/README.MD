# Interview notes

## 2 hours, four sections:
- 30 minutes assorted questions from multithreading, to database, to front end, to API's
- 30 minutes create a javascript tic tac toe board, then add AI moves, then have it play against you with inputs
- 30 minutes try to debug the webcrawler and get its 4 failing tests running
- 30 minutes to just ask someone about their background and maybe some stuff about their experience, whatever
